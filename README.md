> *This really is for me and my friends. **(my first enemies)***

# Installation 

you can do it using `npm` or another packager manager, i prefer use  `pnpm`

    <blockquote style="padding-left:10px;margin-top:10px">
    <i> an <strong>args parser for text commands</strong>,
    which adds various syntax for more convenient use of said commands,
    to the standard one provided.</i>
    </blockquote>
  </summary>

### Installation

After you install `yunaforseyfert` you need to import `Yuna` like this

```js
import { Yuna } from "yunaforseyfert";
```

Then, you need to add it as seyfert's default argsParser, as follows

```js
import { HandleCommand } from "seyfert/lib/commands/handle";
import { Yuna } from "yunaforseyfert";

class YourHandleCommand extends HandleCommand {
    argsParser = Yuna.parser(); // Here are the settings, but that will be explained below
}
// your bot's client
client.setServices({
    handleCommand: YourHandleCommand,
});

```

And now, the magic will begin!

### How this works, and what do?

Let's say you have the following command

```js
const options = {
  first: createStringOption({
    description: "Penguins are life",
    required: true
  }),
  second: createStringOption({
    description: "Do you know i love penguins?",
    required: true
  })
}

@Declare({
  name: 'test',
  description: 'Test command'
})
@Options(options)
export default class TestCommand extends Command {

  async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>) { 

    const { first, second } = ctx.options;

    const embed = new Embed({
        title: "Parsed!",
        fields: [
            {
                name: "First",
                value: first
            },
            {
                name: "Second",
                value: second
            }
        ]
    })

    await ctx.write({
      embeds: [embed]
    });
  }

}
```

The command has two options `first` and `second`, in that order.


For the parser, each word counts as an option, and will be added in the order of the command. That is, if we use the command in the following way:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xdpSRIg.png" width="100%" />


`ctx.options` will be return 
```json
{
    "first": "Hellow!",
    "second": "penguin"
}
```

But, if i want to use more than one word?

You can use the following syntax

`"your words"` `'your beutiful sentence'` **\`penguin world\`**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Us2zi3V.png" width="100%" />

it will return 

```json
{
    "first": "your words",
    "second": "your beatiful sentence"
}
```
Another case is that the option is the last or only one, in this case it will not be necessary to use "" and all the remaining content will be taken as the option. Example:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MayfQbj.png" width="100%" />

#### Named Syntax

**What if I want to use the options in the order I want or need?**

you can use the following syntaxes

`--option` content

`-option` content

`option:` content

Like this.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6olfDEu.png" width="100%" />

Also, if an option is of type `Boolean` , when used with only the `-option` or `--option` syntax with nothing else following it, it will return true. Example:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T8JwCdY.png" width="100%" />


```jsonc
{
  "first": "hello",
  "devmode": "true" // will later be converted to true.
}
```



#### Escaping characters

You can escape any special character or syntax, if you need to, using `\`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/i1SROrV.png" width="100%"/>

this will return:

```json
{
    "first": "hey!",
    "second": "how are you? --second well."
}
```
also this works with 

`"` `'` **\`** 

`:` `-` `--` *(in named options)*

`/` *(in urls, like https://)*

### Config
The configurations allow changing the behavior of the parser; this is done when using `Yuna.parser` The allowed ones are as follows:

```ts
Yuna.parser({
    /**
     * this only show console.log with the options parsed.
     * @default false */
    logResult: false,
    /** syntaxes enabled */
    syntax: {
        /** especify what longText tags you want
         *
         * " => "penguin life"
         *
         * ' => 'beautiful sentence'
         *
         * ` => `Eve„ÄéInsomnia„Äè is a good song`
         *
         * @default üêß all enabled
         */
        longTextTags: ['"', "'", "`"],
        /** especify what named syntax you want
         *
         *  -  => -option content value
         *
         *  -- => --option content value
         *
         *  :  => option: content value
         *
         * @default üêß all enabled
         */
        namedOptions: ["-", "--", ":"]
    },

    /**
     * Turning it on can be useful for when once all the options are obtained,
     * the last one can take all the remaining content, ignoring any other syntax.
     * @default {false}
     */
    breakSearchOnConsumeAllOptions: false,

    /**
     * Limit that you can't use named syntax "-" and ":" at the same time,
     * but only the first one used, sometimes it's useful to avoid confusion.
     * @default {false}
     */
    useUniqueNamedSyntaxAtSameTime: false,
    /**
    * This disables the use of longTextTags in the last option
    * @default {false}
    */
    disableLongTextTagsInLastOption: false,


    /** Use Yuna's choice resolver instead of the default one, put null if you don't want it,
     * 
     * YunaChoiceResolver allows you to search through choices regardless of case or lowercase, 
     * as well as allowing direct use of an choice's value,
     * and not being forced to use only the name. 
     * 
     * @default enabled
     */
    resolveCommandOptionsChoices: {
        /** Allow you to use the value of a choice directly, not necessarily search by name
         * @default {true}
         */
        canUseDirectlyValue: true;
    };

    /** If the first option is of the 'User' type,
     *  it can be taken as the user to whom the message is replying.
     *  @default {null} (not enabled)
     */
    useRepliedUserAsAnOption: {
        /** need to have the mention enabled (@PING)
         * @default {false}
         */
        requirePing: false;
    };
})
```

**disableLongTextTagsInLastOption example**


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2BNIBIx.png" width="100%" />


**useRepliedUserAsAnOption**

> Suppose we have a command with two options, `user` and `message`. As long as we have the `useRepliedUserAsAnOption` option set, the `user` option will be taken as the user to whom the message is replying, and the other options (if any) will be used normally in the message. In case you are not replying to any message `user` will have to be specified in the message, as it is normally. Example:

**replying example**


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7aujz0w.png" width="100%" />

**not replying example**


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/llpFwE9.png" width="100%" />

Also, if necessary, each command can use a specific configuration. For this, you can use the `@DeclareParserConfig` decorator

```js
import { DeclareParserConfig } from "yunaforseyfert";


const options = {
    first: createStringOption({
        description: "first option",
        required: true,
    }),
};

@Declare({
    name: "test",
    description: "with penguins the life is better.",
})
@Options(options)
@DeclareParserConfig({
  // Place your settings here
}) 
export default class TestCommand extends Command {}
```

Also, we provide some recommended configurations `(only one at the moment :] )` for commands such as an Eval.

This can be used as

```js
import { DeclareParserConfig, ParserRecommendedConfig } from "yunaforseyfert";


@DeclareParserConfig(ParserRecommendedConfig.Eval)
```
This will enable **disableLongTextTagsInLastOption** and **breakSearchOnConsumeAll**. Things that I consider necessary in an eval.

  <br/>

  <blockquote style="padding-left:10px;margin-top:10px">
  <i>a resolver, which provides some extra functions. </i>
  </blockquote>
  </summary>

### Installation

Set `Yuna.resolve` as the default `resolveCommandFromContent` of seyfert, as follows:

```js

import { HandleCommand } from "seyfert/lib/commands/handle";
import { Yuna } from "yunaforseyfert";

class YourHandleCommand extends HandleCommand {

  resolveCommandFromContent = Yuna.resolver({
      /**
       * You need to pass the client in order to prepare the commands that the resolver will use.
      */
      client: this.client,
      /**
       * Event to be emitted each time the commands are prepared.
      */
      afterPrepare: (metadata) => {
          this.client.logger.debug(`Ready to use ${metadata.commands.length} commands !`);
      },
  });

}

yourBotClient.setServices({
  handleCommand: YourHandleCommand,
});
```

After this, you are ready to enjoy the following advantages!

### Case insensitive

> use your commands regardless of case , it will sound stupid in some cases
> 
> but I have seen users try to use them with capital letters. üêß

### Shortcuts 

Accesses a subcommand or group, without the need to place the parent command. For example, you would normally access it as `music play`, now you can access it directly as `play`.

To configure it in your subcommands, you must use the `@Shortcut` decorator.

```ts
import { Shortcut } from "yunaforseyfert";

@Declare({
    name: "example",
    description: "example subCommand",
})
@Group("penguin")
@Shortcut()
export default class ExampleSubCommand extends SubCommand {
    // ...
}

```
And now it can be accessed directly as `example` without the parent command.

In groups the configuration is as follows, you must add the `shortcut` property as `true` in your group. Example:

```ts
/** ... */
@Groups({
  penguin: {
      defaultDescription: "penguin group",
      shortcut: true,
  }
})
export default class ParentCommand extends Command {}
```

And now the subCommand shown above can also be accessed as `penguin example` without the parent.

### fallbackSubCommand

Used to access a default subcommand, in case one is not found.

Suppose you have the following command structure:

```
- parent
    - sub1
    - group
        - sub
    - sub2
    - sub3
 ```

And the user has tried to use `parent sub4`

since that subcommand does not exist, `sub1` (or another specified one, but by default it will be the first one, from the parent or group) will be used.

It is also useful to use a subcommand without placing its name.

To enable this feature globally, when using `Yuna.resolve`, add the `useFallbackSubCommand` property as `true`. Example:

```ts
Yuna.resolver({
  //...
  useFallbackSubCommand: true,
})
```

### Note

For the correct functioning of the resolver the commands must be prepared, this is done by default after they are all loaded or reloaded. But if you reload a specific Command/SubCommand it is recommended that you reprepare the commands manually, this can be done by:

```ts 
import { Yuna } from "yunaforseyfert"

Yuna.commands.prepare(client /* your bot's client */)
```

It can also be enabled/disabled on a specific parent command using the `@DeclareFallbackSubCommand` decorator as follows:

```ts
import { DeclareFallbackSubCommand } from "yunaforseyfert";
import PrimarySubCommand from "./primary.js"

@Options([PrimarySubCommand, /* ...*/])
@DeclareFallbackSubCommand(PrimarySubCommand) // You must pass the class of the subCommand that will be taken by default, or null to disable this feature.
export default class ParentCommand extends Command {}
```

In a group it is established as follows: 

```ts
import PrimaryGroupSubCommand from "./penguin/primary.js"

/** ... */
@Groups({
  penguin: {
      defaultDescription: "penguin group",
      fallbackSubCommand: PrimaryGroupSubCommand,
  }
})
export default class ParentCommand extends Command {}
```

  <i>A simple solution to be able to manage when a message is edited and update the command options. </i>
  </blockquote>
  </summary>

### Implementation and Usage

You have some ways to use it, use whichever you prefer. They are practically the same.

#### `@Watch` Decorator Way

```ts
import { Watch } from "yunaforseyfert";

/** ... */
@Options(options)
export default class TestCommand extends Command {
  // example
  @Watch({ time: 100_000  /** 100s */  })
  async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>) {
    ctx.editOrReply({ content: ctx.options.text });
  }
}
```
And now it will be updated every time the message is edited!

##### `@Watch` options 

```ts
@Watch({
  filter(ctx) { return true },
  time: 100_000,
  /** Downtime until the watcher stops. */
  idle: 10_000, 

  // others optionally events

  /**
   * It will be emitted before creating the watcher,
   * if you return `false` it will not be created.
   */
  beforeCreate(ctx) {},

  /** 
   * when the user has removed or used an unrecognized prefix, or changed the command he was using.
    * reason can be: "UnspecifiedPrefix" | "CommandChanged"
  */
  onUsageError(error) { console.log({ error }) },
  /** when there was an error when parsing options */
  onOptionsError(error) { console.log({ error }) },

  onStop(reason) { 
    this.ctx.editOrReply({ content: `watcher stopped by reason: ${reason}` }) 
  },
})
```


#### `createWatcher` function Way

```ts
import { createWatcher } from "yunaforseyfert";

// and now use it in your commands in the following way

/** ... */
@Options(options)
export default class TestCommand extends Command {
  // example
  async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>) {

    const msg = await ctx.editOrReply({ content: ctx.options.text });

    // checks that there is a message to be observed
    if(!msg || !ctx.message) return;

    const watcher = createWatcher(ctx, {
      // how long will the watcher last
      time: 100_000,
      // you also have the idle property
    });

    // Find out when the message has changed and get the new options.
    watcher.onChange((options) => {
      msg.edit({ content: options.text });
    });

    // others optionally events
    watcher.onStop((reason) => {
      ctx.write({ content: `watcher stopped by reason: ${reason}` });
    })

    watcher.onOptionsError((error) => console.log({ error }))

    watcher.onUsageError((reason) => console.log({ reason }))

    // to stop a watcher use
    watcher.stop("reason")

  }
}


```

if necessary you can also create a watcher as follows

```ts
createWatcher<typeof options>({
  client, // your client
  command, // used command
  message, // msg
}, { 
  /* options...*/ 
})
```

#### `Yuna.watchers` utils

- **`Yuna.watchers.createController`**

By default all watchers are stored in a `Map`, but if you wanted to you could use a `LimitedCollection` as follows:

```ts
import { LimitedCollection } from "seyfert";

Yuna.watchers.createController({
  client, // your bot's client
  cache: new LimitedCollection( /** your settings */)
})
```
- **`Yuna.watchers.getFromContext`**

Get the list of `watchers` (there may be more than one) associated to a `CommandContext`

```ts
Yuna.watchers.getFromContext(ctx)
```
- **`Yuna.watchers.findInstances`**

Find watchers from a query.

```ts
/** 
 * This method returns the key (id where it is stored) of the watcher, and its instances in an array. 
 * @returns 
 * {
 *  id: string,
 *  instances: MessageWatcher[]
 * }
 * */
Yuna.watchers.findInstances(client, {
  /** query properties */
  userId: ctx.author.id,
  // messageId
  // channelId
  // guildId
  // command {Command | SubCommand}
})

// the query can also be a callback that returns a boolean
Yuna.watchers.findInstances(client, (watcher) => watcher.message.author.id === ctx.author.id)
```

- **`Yuna.watchers.getManyInstances`**

Similar to `findInstances` but this one will filter through all, it is used in the same way, but it will return all matches with the following type:
```ts
{
 id: string,
 instances: MessageWatcher[]
}[]
```

- **`Yuna.watchers.isWatching`**

Use it to know when a `CommandContext` is being observed.

- **`Use example`**

Suppose you want to limit that a user can only have one watcher at a time in your command.

Using the `@Watch` decorator you would do it with the beforeCreate event, and with `createWatcher` before executing that function.  Example with the `beforeCreate`

```ts
@Watch({
  idle: 10_000,
  beforeCreate(ctx) {
    // Get some watcher associated to the user in this command
    const userWatcher = Yuna.watchers.findInstances(ctx.client, {
        userId: ctx.author.id,
        command: this, // this refers to the Command
    });

    // If not, we do not proceed.
    if (!userWatcher) return;
    //From there, get the first MessageWatcher of the previous message (the one we want to stop watching).
    const [watcher] = userWatcher.instances;
    // stop all instances of that message.
    watcher?.stopAll("AnotherInstanceCreated");
  }
})
```

> Also, `Watch` is an alias for `Yuna.watchers` :)

Also the `enabled` configuration of the `Yuna.parser` has been renamed to `syntax`.
```diff
